        <h1>What's philosophy</h1>
        <p>Quite literally, the term "philosophy" means, "love of wisdom." In a broad sense, philosophy is an activity people undertake when they seek to understand 
            fundamental truths about themselves, the world in which they live, and their relationships to the world and to each other. As an academic discipline philosophy 
            is much the same. Those who study philosophy are perpetually engaged in asking, answering, and arguing for their answers to lifes most basic questions. To make 
            such a pursuit more systematic academic philosophy is traditionally divided into major areas of study.</p>
        <h3>Misconceptions</h3>
        <p>When someone thinks about a philosopher in modern times, the common consensus is a out of shape university professor as the art of philosophy doesn't require physical
             involvement, right? That's where people go wrong, the art of philosophy requires physical strain for they know that the mind is only as strong as the body that holds it.

        <h3>History Of philosophy</h3>
        <p>Philosophy has been around since the dawn of western civilization. The golden age of Greek philosophy took place in Athens in the 5th century BC. The works of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle informed thousands of years of thought, becoming central to thought in the Roman world, the Middle Ages, and then resurfacing in the renaissance and later.<br><br>

            Starting at the height of the Roman republic, Christian thought was central to philosophy at least until the enlightenment. In the 18th century, questions of how we come to know what we believe we know (epistemology), and new ethical schools began to form. By the late 1800â€™s, questions of language, logic, and meaning took center stage, and the 20th century played host to one of the largest bursts of philosophical work ever seen. Today philosophical thought is applied to almost every component of life, from science to warfare, politics to artificial intelligence.<br><br>
